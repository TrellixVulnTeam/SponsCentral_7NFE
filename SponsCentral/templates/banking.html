    <b><p>Time to seal it with a transaction.</p></b>
    <p>To make the process easier, here are some links for net banking <i>(We're a new developing website, so we couldn't facilitate gateways. However, we try our best to give you as nice an experience as we can! We would be gladly grateful if you are willing to sponsor us here. Thanks! )</i></p> <!--'here' mein 'Contact Us' ka href laga dena-->
<br>
    <p>The transaction may be made online by some of the following methods <i>(these facilities are provided by every bank; user interface and limitations/charges may differ for different banks):</</p>
<br>
    <!--ordered/unordered list; names in bold. Adaquate spacing between list elements-->
<br>
    <b>1 - Immediate Payment Service (IMPS):</b>
    <p>A 24x7 service.*</p>
<br>
    <b>2 - National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT):</b>
    <p>Normally, the minimum transaction amount required for NEFT is Rs 1 and the maximum amount allowed is Rs 10 Lakh. *</p>
<br>
    <b>3 - Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS):</b>
    <p>The fund transfer limit through RTGS is usually from Rs 2 Lakh to Rs 10 Lakh. Can be made only during the bank's working hours and working days.*</p>
<br>
    <b>4 - Unified Payment Interface (UPI):</b>
    <p>UPI can be used fro immediate fund transfer. It uses the same system as IMPS, but is meant for mobile transfer using the bankâ€™s app. The transaction may be made via the app downloaded on a phone by entering the payee ID and the amount detail. *</p>
